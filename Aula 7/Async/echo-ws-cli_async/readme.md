This is a Java Web Service client that is able to call operations asynchronously.

The client uses the wsimport tool (included with the JDK since version 6)
to generate classes that can invoke the web service and
perform the Java to XML data conversion.

The client needs access to the WSDL file,
either using HTTP or using the local file system.

The client also needs to create a binding file (async.binding.xml), which
is pointed to by the wsimport command through the <bindingDirectory> tag.
This file modified the generated code to allow the use of asynchronous operations.


## Instructions using Maven:

You must start async-ws first.

The default binding files location is ${basedir}/src/jaxws .
The binding directory can be specified in pom.xml
project/build/plugins/plugin[artifactId="jaxws-maven-plugin"]/configuration/bindingDirectory

The jaxws-maven-plugin is run at the "generate-sources" Maven phase (which is before the compile phase).

To generate stubs using wsimport:
```
mvn generate-sources
```

To compile:
```
mvn compile
```

To run using exec plugin:
```
mvn exec:java
```

To generate launch scripts for Windows and Linux:
  (appassembler:assemble is attached to install phase)
```
mvn install
```

To run using appassembler plugin:
- On Windows:
    ```
    target\appassembler\bin\echo-ws-cli_async http://localhost:8080/echo-ws/endpoint
    ```
- On Linux:
    ```
    ./target/appassembler/bin/echo-ws-cli_async http://localhost:8080/echo-ws/endpoint
    ```

## To configure the Maven project in Eclipse:

'File', 'Import...', 'Maven'-'Existing Maven Projects'
'Select root directory' and 'Browse' to the project base folder.
Check that the desired POM is selected and 'Finish'.
