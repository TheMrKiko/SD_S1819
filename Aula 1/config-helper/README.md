# Configuration helper library

This is a simple Java module 
that loads configuration values from a property file in resources.

The properties file follows the 
[name=value syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties).

The _min_ and _max_ values are just simple properties to exemplify.


## Instructions for using Maven

To compile:

```
mvn compile
```

To install in the local Maven repository
(where it can later be found as a dependency):

```
mvn install
```


## To configure the Maven project in Eclipse

'File', 'Import...', 'Maven'-'Existing Maven Projects'

'Select root directory' and 'Browse' to the project base folder.

Check that the desired POM is selected and 'Finish'.
